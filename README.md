# Straighter Than An Arrow

Bows and crossbows do not fire arrows exactly where you are looking. They add some randomness to it, so the arrows go slightly off course. This is why when you fire lots of arrows without turning at all, not all the arrows land in the same spot.

This mod removes that randomness so they always go in the exact direction you are looking.

There is also a bug in this version which causes arrows to not land in the right spot when they hit a block, which this mod fixes.

So in total, this mod:
- removes spread from firing arrows out of bows
- removes spread from firing arrows out of crossbows
- Fixes a bug causing arrows to shift to the side slightly when impacting blocks, making it seem like the arrow isn't firing straight
